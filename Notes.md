Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is considered the most accurate equation for calculating BMR
BMR - basal metabolic rate, the amount of energy expended per day at rest.
1 Calorie (kcal) = 4.1868 kj

_Mifflin-St Jeor Equation_
For men:
BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5
For women:
BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161

1575	- bmr | 2166 - light(1.38) | 2307 - moderate(1.46) | 2717 - intense(1.73)


_Weight loss_  
- It is inadvisable to lower calorie intake by more than 1,000 calories per day, as losing 
  more than 2 pounds per week can be unhealthy, and can result in the opposite effect in  the near future by reducing metabolism


_Ideal weight_
How much a person should weigh is not an exact science. It is highly dependent on each individual. Thus far, there is no measure, be it IBW, body mass index (BMI), or any other that can definitively state how much a person should weigh to be healthy. They are only references, and it's more important to adhere to making healthy life choices such as regular exercise, eating a variety of unprocessed foods, getting enough sleep, etc. than it is to chase a specific weight based on a generalized formula.

Generally, females weigh less than males even though they naturally have a higher percentage of body fat. This is because the male body generally has higher muscle mass, and muscle is heavier than fat. Not only that, but women generally have lower bone density. Last but not least, males tend to be taller than females.

_B. J. Devine Formula (ideal wt)_ 
Male:	   50.0 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet
Female:	45.5 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet

Output = current wt / ideal wt + current bmi / ideal bmi 
OR
just wt gain/ loss

*use the Devine formula for Men, and use the Robinson formula for Women.*
